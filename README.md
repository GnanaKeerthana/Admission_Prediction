# 🎓 Graduate Admission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the chance of a student’s admission to a graduate program based on their academic profile and test scores. Using machine learning regression techniques, it analyzes features such as GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, and research experience to estimate the probability of admission success.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Graduate admission depends on multiple factors — academic scores, research experience, and other credentials. This project builds a **Predictive model** to estimate a student’s likelihood of admission using data-driven analysis.

**Goal:**  
To create a model that accurately predicts the probability of admission based on input parameters.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Used
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding feature importance using visualizations.  
- **Feature Selection** – Identifying the most influential parameters.  
- **Model Building** – Using **Linear Regression** to predict admission chances.  
- **Model Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy and performance using metrics such as R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
