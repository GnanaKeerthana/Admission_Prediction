# 🎓 Graduate Admission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the chance of a student’s admission to a graduate program based on their academic profile and test scores. Using machine learning regression techniques, it analyzes features such as GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, and research experience to estimate the probability of admission success.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Graduate admission depends on multiple factors — academic scores, research experience, and other credentials. This project builds a **Predictive model** to estimate a student’s likelihood of admission using data-driven analysis.

**Goal:**  
To create a model that accurately predicts the probability of admission based on input parameters.
